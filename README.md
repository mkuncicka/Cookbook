Cookway
========================

Project started during boot-camp in CodersLab. Now living it's own life.

###Idea of the app
I would like the Cookway to be the place where you can exchange your best recipes with your
friends - it will derive from the idea of social media which will give you posibility to follow
recipes of the people with the same taste as you have.

###Version 1.0
Firs version of the app is very simple. It don't implement all of the planed functionality.
What it let you do now? Here it is:
<ul>
<li>you can see all the recipes</li>
</ul>
<p>After login you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>add your recipes</li>
<li>add comments to all recipes</li>
<li>follow users with the good taste and see only their recipes on the main site</li>
<li>ofcourse you can edit and delete all of staff you added</li>
</ul>

###What is comming next?
<p>Cookway will not keep still - all the time it will be changing for you. Comming soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>user profiles - you will have a chance to say something about you</li>
<li>rating - users will rate recipes they've tried - maybe you will get to the podium?</li>
</ul>
